                    <label class="answer">
                        Simply contact your opponent via our Discord server or Discord DMs to agree on a date and map for your match. Keep in mind that your opponent might be in a different time zone,
                        so reach out well in advance. Feel free to use both <a class="link" :href="discordTimeStamps" target="_other">Discord's Unix timestamp feature</a> and Discord events to avoid
                        misunderstandings and make planning as easy as possible for both you and your opponent.

                    <label class="answer">
                        Your initial division placement is determined by your BP and estimated capabilities. If you're unhappy with your placement, you can contest it before the season starts.

                        To enter a score you have to be logged in as the discord account you signed up with 
                        and press on the pencil icon next to the match of yours you want to enter a score for.
                        You can only enter scores for your own matches.
                    </label>

                    <label class="answer">
                        Congratulations, you've won your match! It's up to you whether you'd like to enjoy the victory or give your opponent another chance. If you choose to claim the win, you can

                        If you want to leave PORC, simply enter all your remaining matches as 0-3 in your opponents' favor. Ideally, you should also announce your resignation to your fellow rumblers
                        in your division to avoid confusion.
